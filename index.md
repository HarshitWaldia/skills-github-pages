## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of.

### 1. DocTalk: An LLM-powered PDF Chatbot
*An intelligent chatbot designed to interact with and extract information from PDF documents.*

This project features an LLM-powered chatbot that allows users to have natural conversations with their PDF files. I implemented LangChain to build robust conversational flows and used semantic search techniques to significantly enhance the accuracy and relevance of the retrieved information. The result is a seamless, user-friendly interface for document interaction.

*   **Technologies Used:** Python, LangChain, OpenAI API
*   **Source Code:** [View on GitHub](https://github.com/harshitwaldia/your-repo-link) <!-- TODO: Replace with your actual repo link -->

### 2. EmotionaAI: Face Emotion Recognition System
*A real-time system that detects and identifies human emotions from facial expressions.*

I developed a real-time emotion recognition system using a deep learning model built with Keras and TensorFlow. The application uses OpenCV for face detection and applies the trained model to predict emotions, providing instant feedback. This project showcases my skills in computer vision and practical deep learning implementation.
